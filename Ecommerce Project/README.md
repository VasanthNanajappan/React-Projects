Hello Sir, 
Iam Vasanth you can able to run this project by using this link -https://ecommerce-app-reactproject.netlify.app/
Here the Products are rendered "DYNAMICALLY" not the Product Page(it was hard Coded)
I tried my best in responsive web design
The "X" symbol just takes the page off ,it wont get back to home page sir!
I don't want to make an EXCUSE for the mistakes i made, it was totally done by me and i take the full responsibility, So Kindly evaluate it and Give me a constructive FeedBack Sir!
By any chance i get to Work as an INTERN in your Company ,It will help my career to level up 10x times and I can provide you a good service under your Guidance!
Thank You sir!
